![Alt text](discord_img.png)

#### Using Discord from Linux is a terrible experience.
Because, It has to reinstall every time whenever release new update version of discord. It's very HASSLE!   
Now, let's escape from that HASSLE thing!

# Getting Start

### Add ppa & install discord-on-linux
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:seokil/discord-on-linux
$ sudo apt install discord-on-linux
```

### Just type this and you're done!
```
$ discord-on-linux
```
